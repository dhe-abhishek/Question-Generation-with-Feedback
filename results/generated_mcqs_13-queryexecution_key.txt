Question: A database system is being optimized for a high-frequency OLTP workload where queries typically retrieve only one or two tuples at a time. Which processing model should the developers apply to minimize function call overhead and buffer allocation for intermediate results?
Options:
  A) Iterator Model
  B) Materialization Model
  C) Vectorized Model
  D) Pipeline Model
Answer: B

Question: Suppose a DBMS is performing a sequential scan on a table and encounters a page where the Zone Map shows a MAX value of 400 and a MIN value of 100 for the 'val' column. If the query is 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE val > 600', how will the system apply the Zone Map data?
Options:
  A) It will scan the page anyway to verify the AVG value.
  B) It will skip the page because the MAX value (400) is less than the predicate value (600).
  C) It will use the SUM aggregate to estimate if the value exists.
  D) It will check the COUNT to determine if it should scan the page.
Answer: B

Question: A query 'SELECT * FROM students WHERE age < 30 AND dept = "CS"' is executed using a Multi-Index Scan. The system has already retrieved a set of Record IDs for 'age < 30' and a separate set for 'dept = "CS"'. What is the next step the system must take to apply this access method correctly?
Options:
  A) Perform a union of the two Record ID sets.
  B) Compute the intersection of the Record ID sets using a bitmap or hash table.
  C) Discard the index results and perform a sequential scan.
  D) Retrieve the records for 'age < 30' and then filter for 'CS' manually.
Answer: B

Question: An engineer notices that an 'UPDATE' query on a clustered index is causing a single tuple to be updated multiple times because its physical location changes during the scan. To apply the standard solution for the Halloween Problem, what should the DBMS do?
Options:
  A) Switch from an Index Scan to a Sequential Scan.
  B) Use JIT compilation for the update expression.
  C) Track modified record IDs for the duration of the query to prevent re-visiting them.
  D) Materialize the entire table into a temporary buffer before starting the update.
Answer: C

Question: A DBMS is processing the query: 'SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = UPPER("electronics")'. Before evaluating this for every tuple in the table, how would the system apply the 'Constant Folding' optimization?
Options:
  A) By identifying repeated sub-expressions across multiple queries.
  B) By pre-computing UPPER("electronics") to "ELECTRONICS" once and using that result for all comparisons.
  C) By converting the string comparison into a machine code function using LLVM.
  D) By skipping the predicate evaluation if the category index exists.
Answer: B
