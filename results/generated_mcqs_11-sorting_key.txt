Question: What are the two main phases of the External Merge Sort algorithm?
Answer: The first phase is Sorting, where chunks of data are sorted in memory and written to disk. The second phase is Merging, where the sorted runs are combined into larger sorted runs.

Question: What is the primary benefit of using a clustered B+Tree for sorting?
Answer: Using a clustered B+Tree is always better than external sorting because there is no computational cost and all disk access is sequential by traversing the leaf pages.
