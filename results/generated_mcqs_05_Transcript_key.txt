--- Question 1 ---
Bloom's Level: 2 (Understanding)
Question: Which of the following best explains the core principle of the binary search algorithm?
Options:
  A) It sequentially checks each element from the beginning until the target is found.
  B) It repeatedly divides the sorted list in half and compares the target with the middle element to narrow the search.
  C) It requires the list to be unsorted to work efficiently.
  D) It compares the target element with the first and last elements of the list only.
Answer: It repeatedly divides the sorted list in half and compares the target with the middle element to narrow the search.

Bloom's Level: 2 (Understanding)
Question: Why is it a mandatory precondition for a list to be sorted before applying binary search?
Options:
  A) Because calculating the middle index is impossible on an unsorted list.
  B) To ensure that the first element is always the one being searched for.
  C) So the algorithm can logically eliminate half of the remaining elements after one comparison.
  D) Because sorting the list reduces its size, making the search faster.
Answer: So the algorithm can logically eliminate half of the remaining elements after one comparison.

--- Question 3 ---
Bloom's Level: 2 (Understanding)
Question: How would you contrast the approach of linear search with that of binary search?
Options:
  A) Linear search uses a sequential approach, while binary search uses a divide and conquer approach.
  B) Linear search is for large datasets, while binary search is for small datasets.
  C) Linear search requires sorted data, while binary search works on unsorted data.
  D) Linear search has a best-case complexity of O(log n), while binary search has O(1).
Answer: Linear search uses a sequential approach, while binary search uses a divide and conquer approach.

--- Question 4 ---
Bloom's Level: 2 (Understanding)
Question: In a binary search on a list sorted in ascending order, what is the next step if the middle element is greater than the element being searched for?
Options:
  A) The search continues in the right half of the subarray.
  B) The search is terminated as the element is not in the list.
  C) The entire list is searched again from the beginning.
  D) The search continues in the left half of the subarray.
Answer: The search continues in the left half of the subarray.

--- Question 5 ---
Bloom's Level: 2 (Understanding)
Question: What is the main implication of binary search having a worst-case time complexity of O(log n)?
Options:
  A) The search time increases at the same rate as the size of the list.
  B) The number of comparisons required grows very slowly, even for extremely large lists.
  C) The algorithm is only efficient for small-sized datasets.
  D) The element will always be found in the first comparison.
Answer: The number of comparisons required grows very slowly, even for extremely large lists.
